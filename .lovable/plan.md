# Hero Section — Content & CTA Update

Update `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` with painting-specific content. No layout, animation, or styling changes.

## Changes

### 1. Imports
- Remove `import { Link } from "react-router-dom"` (only used for the CTA button in this file)

### 2. Headlines
- Mobile and desktop: "Remodels" → "Painting" (two places)

### 3. Subheadline
- "Clear scope, clean work, and a finished result you're proud to show off." → "Clean prep, flawless finishes, and results you'll love showing off."

### 4. CTA Button
- Replace `<Link to="/contact">` with `<a href="tel:+17204475654">`

### 5. Trust Chips
- "15+ Years" → "8+ Years"
- "500+ Projects" → "1,000+ Homes"

### 6. Licensed Text
- "Serving Colorado homeowners" → "Serving Denver & the Front Range"

### 7. Image Alt Text
- "Luxury Colorado mountain home" → "Freshly painted Colorado home exterior"

All changes are text/content swaps within the existing structure. No layout, spacing, gradients, or animation changes.
